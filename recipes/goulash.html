    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Hungarian goulash recipe is a spicy way to dress up stew beef. My mom made this when we were kids, and we loved it. It is spicy but not mouth-burning!<br/> It can be made with cheaper cuts of beef and will still turn out very tender. If the stew gets too thick, add a little water while cooking. Garnish with sour cream.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Sweet Paprika</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in oil until soft, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove onions and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Combine paprika, 2 teaspoons salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Coat beef cubes in spice mixture, and cook in the onion pot until brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>Return onions to the pot with beef; pour in water, tomato paste, garlic, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
